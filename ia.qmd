Deadline: 29 Sep 2025

### Objective

This assignment aims to help you apply data analysis techniques to a real-world dataset in the field of Transport and Logistics Management Engineering. You will analyze the dataset, generate meaningful insights, and prepare a structured report using RMarkdown or Quarto with an HTML output.

### Instructions

#### Dataset Selection

Choose a dataset related to transport or logistics management (e.g., shipping data, traffic flow, airline performance, freight transport, public transit, etc.).

The dataset must come from a reliable source (such as government agencies, research repositories, or open data portals).

Include the dataset file in your submission folder.

### Report Structure

Your report should include the following sections:

**1. Introduction (â‰¤ 300 words)**

Briefly describe the context of the dataset, its importance in transport/logistics management, and the purpose of your analysis.

**2. Data Description**

Provide details about the dataset: number of observations, variables, types of variables, and any preprocessing or cleaning steps performed.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Use descriptive statistics, visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar plots, boxplots, scatter plots), and summary tables to explore the dataset.

**4. Key Insights**

Present five insights you discovered from the analysis. Each insight should be clearly explained and supported with evidence (e.g., plots, statistics).

**5. Data Source**

Provide a proper citation or link to the dataset source.

#### Technical Requirements

Use RMarkdown (.Rmd) or Quarto (.qmd) to prepare your analysis.

The output should be in HTML format.

Submit a folder that contains:

The dataset file

Your .Rmd or .qmd file

The generated .html output

### Submission

Upload the entire folder (zipped) with your files.

Ensure that your HTML report is well-structured, readable, and free from major errors.
